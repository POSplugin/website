#     tools/deploy.sh             build origin/main in a throwaway worktree, deploy it
#     tools/deploy.sh --dry-run   build it and say what would ship, deploy nothing
#
# Why not `build-dist.sh && wrangler pages deploy dist` from wherever you are:
# that ships the contents of a working copy, and a working copy is shared state.
# More than one agent session has worked in the same checkout of this repository
# at once. Deploying from it can publish another session's uncommitted edits, or
# a checkout that is behind main and quietly rolls back work that was merged
# minutes ago. dist/ itself is `rm -rf`'d by every build, so two builds at once
# can hand wrangler a half-assembled directory.
#
# So this never reads the caller's working tree or its dist/. It fetches,
# checks origin/main out into a temporary worktree, builds there, deploys that,
# and removes it. What goes live is always a commit that is on main, and the
# deployment records which one.
